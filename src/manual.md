# User manual 

Describe how to use your software, if this makes sense for your code. Almost all projects should have at least some instructions on how to run the code. More extensive instructions can be provided here.

To use the Static analyser, in the command terminal type: python TypeChecker.py. 
This would prompt the user for a python module to run a static type check analysis on.
Afterwards repeat with other test modules if you wish. 
Note ensure the program is in the same directory as the test modules.
